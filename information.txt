This project is entirely my experiment with the Web Speech API.
It's a very powerful browser interface that allows you to record human speech and convert it into text. We will also use it to do the opposite - reading out strings in a human-like voice. 

To showcase the ability of this API I have done the following things with it :
1) Takes notes using voice to text input.
2) Talking the note back to the user in a different voice.

Like other browser API's such as the location fetch API(You can check out my other React made project for it as well.), it is quite 
accurate in nature. Unfortunately this API is only available in chrome browser.


The API is accessible through the speechSynthesis object and there are a couple of methods for playing, pausing and other audio related stuff. It also has a couple of cool options that change the pitch, rate, and even the voice of the reader.

All I used is the speak() method. It expects one argument, an instance of the SpeechSynthesisUtterance class.
